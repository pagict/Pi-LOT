#Pi-LOT
##What is it?
Pi-LOT is a Weibo demo written for iOS out of the reason that I want to introspect how well I acquired the iOS development. 

__So for short, it is a immature iOS project. __

##Features

- I applied design pattern as far as I could best, typically it is a MVC model in use.
- Observer pattern is implemented for updating UI while data in models obtained from the server.
- Because that I lost comprehension of Weibo SDK offered by Sina officials, it's only a web API-based version.
